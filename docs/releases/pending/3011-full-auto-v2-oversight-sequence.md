# Full-Auto v2 mirror oversight sequence is now durable across restarts

## Summary

- The v2 reactive-intercept mirror (`mirrorReactiveVerdictToV2` in
  `src/hooks/full-auto-intercept.ts`) allocated its `oversight_sequence` from
  a module-level counter that re-zeroed on every process restart. A restarted
  process re-issued sequences 1, 2, … which duplicated `full_auto_oversight`
  identity in `.swarm/events.jsonl` and destructively OVERWROTE persisted
  `.swarm/evidence/{phase}/full-auto-N.json` records, because the evidence
  writer derives its filename from the stamped sequence (#3011).
- The counter is deleted. The mirror now allocates through the same durable
  allocator the v1 dispatcher uses — `nextFullAutoOversightSequence`
  (`src/full-auto/state.ts`) — placed after the durable-session skip so a
  skipped mirror burns no sequence and performs no state write. v1 and v2 now
  share one `withStateLock`-guarded collision domain.
- The allocator itself was hardened against an upgrade window found in plan
  review: it now catches the persisted counter up to the highest sequence
  observable in existing evidence filenames
  (`.swarm/evidence/<numeric-phase>/full-auto-N.json`) inside the same lock,
  so a directory written by the OLD buggy code (evidence files present,
  counter still 0) can never have an evidence file reissued over it. The
  catch-up walk descends only into numeric phase directories — the evidence
  tree also holds per-task-id directories (plus `gate-audit/` and `sbom/`)
  that the oversight writer never uses — keeping the locked walk bounded by
  plan phase count. Missing or non-directory evidence paths scan as 0; an
  unexpected scan failure throws a stable typed error (raw filesystem detail
  goes to the log only, never into v1 pause reasons).
- Both the persisted counter and scanned filename values are honored only as
  non-negative safe integers: a corrupt persisted counter is ignored and
  re-derived from disk, a hand-planted `full-auto-<huge>.json` filename
  cannot pin the allocation, and the safe-integer ceiling fails closed
  instead of silently sticking (`n + 1 === n`).
- The filename grammar (`full-auto-{seq}.json`) now lives once in the new
  leaf `src/full-auto/evidence-names.ts`, used by BOTH the evidence writer
  and the allocator's scanner, so the two cannot drift apart.

## Residual (deliberate, precise scope)

The fix guarantees no evidence filename is ever reissued in any directory
shape and that no two post-fix events duplicate each other. Two precise
limits: (1) a post-fix sequence value may still numerically overlap a
BUGGY-ERA event-only (non-evidence) sequence value already present in
`events.jsonl` from before the upgrade — nothing consumes `oversight_sequence`
as a lookup key (phase approval scans evidence files gap-tolerantly), the
event log is append-only audit history, and healing it would require
scanning/rewriting it under the state lock; (2) a process still running the
PRE-fix build against an upgraded directory can still re-issue its own
process-local sequences — the guarantee is a property of the fixed code, not
of version mixes. Both limits are accepted, not oversights.

## Tests

- `tests/unit/hooks/full-auto-intercept-sequence-durability.test.ts` (new):
  fresh-process continuation from the persisted counter, two-process
  no-overwrite coexistence, v1-then-mirror shared collision domain,
  buggy-era-directory healing without overwrite, and phase-approval
  gap-tolerance — all driven through the real
  `dispatchCriticAndWriteEvent`/`dispatchFullAutoOversight` in spawned bun
  child processes (true restart simulation).
- `tests/unit/full-auto/oversight-sequence-allocator.test.ts` (new): direct
  unit coverage of the allocator and its catch-up scan — multi-phase-dir max
  selection, non-numeric directory skipping, missing/non-directory evidence
  roots, safe-integer guards on scanned and persisted values, the stable
  fail-closed scan error with no counter burn, and the safe-integer ceiling.
- `tests/unit/full-auto/oversight-sequence-guardrail.test.ts` (new,
  recurring ratchet): classifies every module-level numeric counter in
  `src/` (defect class "process-local identity state stamped into durable
  records" — #2576/#2720/#3011), fails on any NEW unclassified counter,
  demonstrates the classifier biting on the original #3011 defect shape, and
  pins the writer/scanner grammar coupling through the shared leaf module.
- Note for future readers of the trace acceptance table: the mirrored event
  carries 18 fields (the `FullAutoOversightEvent` interface has 20, with
  `task_id`/`architect_model` optional and omitted by the mirror).

Closes #3011
