# Context-map decision IDs are durable across restarts (issue #2720)

## What

- Architectural-decision IDs in the Context Map are now allocated from the map being
  updated instead of a process-local counter: `allocateDecisionId(decisions)` in
  `src/context-map/post-agent-update.ts` derives `A<max+1>` from the ids already present
  (`^A\d+$`, BigInt-exact so suffixes past 2^53 stay precise), mirroring the summaries fix
  for #2576 (`allocateSummaryId`). After a plugin reload or host restart, recording a
  decision into a map that already holds `A1..A3` now allocates `A4` instead of re-issuing
  `A1`, so `.swarm/context-map.json` no longer accumulates duplicate `DecisionEntry.id`
  values across restarts.
- The module-level `decisionCounter` is gone; ids are never derived from process state.
- New unit suites pin the allocation contract: `decision-id-allocation.test.ts`
  (14 tests — fresh map starts at `A1`; continuation from the max suffix (contiguous,
  non-contiguous, and leading-zero legacy ids); foreign/non-`A`/non-string ids ignored;
  BigInt exactness beyond 2^53; distinct sequential ids for multiple decisions in one
  call; and a real save-load disk round-trip proving no duplicate ids land in the
  persisted file across a simulated restart); `decision-id-totality.test.ts` (4 tests —
  allocation skips null/non-object entries and near-miss id shapes such as `A1x` or a
  trailing newline in a loadable-but-corrupt map instead of throwing, and the update
  still persists); and `decision-id-roundtrip.test.ts` (1 test — two decisions recorded
  in ONE call witnessed through the real save/load persistence path).
- The `DecisionEntry.id` doc example now states the actual `A1, A2, ...` grammar.

## Why

The counter reset to zero on every process start while the persisted map kept its history,
so the first decision recorded after any restart duplicated an id already in
`.swarm/context-map.json` (issue #2720, found by the #2576 recurrence sweep). Append-only
damage — no entry was destroyed — but duplicate identity is ambiguity for any future or
external consumer that treats the id as a key.

## Notes and boundaries

- No schema, format, or migration change: existing maps (including ones that already
  contain duplicates from the earlier behavior) load and continue as before. Duplicates
  already persisted are NOT healed; allocation simply continues past the max suffix, so no
  NEW duplicate is introduced.
- This guarantees no restart-induced duplication. It does not claim global cross-process
  uniqueness: `saveContextMap` rewrites the whole file last-writer-wins, a pre-existing
  property of every context-map field.
- Boundary: the in-tree Task-tool post-hook (`context_map.enabled` path) does not
  currently pass `decisions`, so today the recording path this hardens is exercised via
  the module's public API (tests, direct callers) rather than by the default hook
  payload. The allocation change is inert for callers that record no decisions. The
  missing producer, the missing capsule consumer, and the two doc overclaims around
  decisions are tracked in #3016.
- Same defect class, different subsystem: the full-auto v2 mirror's process-local
  `reactiveOversightSequence` (which can destructively overwrite evidence files after a
  restart) is tracked separately as #3011.

## Verification

- Frozen issue-tracer checks C1/C2 flip RED→GREEN: a fresh process recording into a map
  holding `A1..A3` allocates `A4`, and a record-save-reload-record cycle persists
  `A1..A5` with no duplicates (`repro-check.sh run`, base 675e9ab03).
- Existing context-map suites stay green (70 pass / 0 fail:
  `post-agent-update`, `post-agent-wiring`, `persistence`), plus the new 14-test
  allocation suite, 4-test totality suite, and 1-test round-trip suite; `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`,
  Node-ESM import of `dist/index.js`, biome, and the check:invariants /
  check:mock-cleanup / check:registry-citations / check:test-clock / drift:check gates
  all pass at the fixed tree.
