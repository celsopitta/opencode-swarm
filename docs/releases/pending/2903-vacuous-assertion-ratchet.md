# Vacuous test-assertion ratchet and 18-site cleanup (issue #2903)

## What

- New diff-scoped CI ratchet `bun run scripts/check-vacuous-assertions.ts` (TypeScript in the `check-test-file-cap.ts` shape; invoked directly because package.json is release-please-owned) that fails the quality job when a PR adds a structurally vacuous test assertion — an assertion that cannot fail regardless of the behavior under test. Five shapes are detected in `*.test.ts` files under `tests/` and `src/`: `expect(x.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)`, the `.size` variant, `expect(true).toBe(true)`, `expect(<literal>).toBe(<same literal>)`, and `expect(<literal>).toBeDefined()`. Falsifiable forms (`indexOf`/`findIndex`/`search` results, numeric counters) are never flagged.
- Pre-existing debt (108 sites across 46 files at introduction) is grandfathered in `scripts/vacuous-assertion-baseline.json` — a flat per-file count map that may only shrink vs the base branch; the baseline-growth arm blocks silent bumps.
- Deliberate probes carry an inline marker: `// vacuous-ok: <reason>` on the assertion's line or the line above. `VACUOUS_ASSERT_ENFORCE=0` soft-warns instead of failing.
- One-time cleanup of the 18 structurally cannot-fail `.length`/`.size >= 0` sites (13 files) the frontier audit enumerated: each replaced with the concrete expectation its test title promises (e.g. the sast-scan test now asserts `findings.length === finding_count`, the dark-matter CRLF tests now pin the actual parse counts), or the new marker where the count is deliberately non-failing (config-doctor's schema-only-bounds documentation probe, the migration table-exists probe, and the Windows lock-residue probe whose count is platform-dependent — the cleanup surfaced that 5 rapid lock releases leave 3 stale `.lock` files on Windows while the old assertion silently passed).
- Detector unit tests (`tests/unit/scripts/check-vacuous-assertions.test.ts`) cover the five rules, precedence, normalization (mixed quotes/whitespace caught; kind-mismatched `'7'` vs `7` not), marker suppression, the `evaluateRatchet` decision table, flat-baseline parsing, and a self-scan assertion that the detector's own test file is clean. An e2e harness (`check-vacuous-assertions-e2e.test.ts`) additionally exercises the real gate in disposable git repositories: a red head-commit violation exits 1 with an ERROR line, `VACUOUS_ASSERT_ENFORCE=0` soft-warns to exit 0, the no-base-branch direction is asserted explicitly, and `--check-file` mode is covered.
- `TESTING.md` documents the ratchet under the writing-tests rules; wired into the CI quality job next to `check:test-file-cap` with the same release-skip guard, and into the commit-pr validation parity surfaces.

## Why

Frontier-audit finding D5: ~300 test sites matched the broad vacuous-grep, 15 (drifting to 18 by implementation time) were structurally cannot-fail, and nothing prevented reintroduction — the only prior fix was a one-off hand edit in PR #2875, and new sites landed in the week after the audit.

## Verification

- `bun run scripts/check-vacuous-assertions.ts --all` at the pre-cleanup commit lists exactly the 18 enumerated `.length`/`.size` sites with zero `indexOf` false positives; at the fixed tree the cleanup-owned class is zero.
- A temp-repository red demonstration (head commit adding exactly one vacuous assertion) exits 1 with an `ERROR` line naming the file; the same tree under `VACUOUS_ASSERT_ENFORCE=0` exits 0 with a soft-warn.
- All 13 edited test files pass individually (`bun --smol test`, XDG-isolated); detector unit suite 32/32, the e2e gate harness 6/6, commit-pr parity test green.
