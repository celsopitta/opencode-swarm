/**
 * The complete retention and read-amplification registry (issue #2036).
 *
 * This is DATA, deliberately not prose: the CI check
 * (`scripts/check-retention-registry.ts`), the unit tests, and
 * `docs/observability-retention-registry.md` all assert against this single
 * artifact, mirroring the `EVENT_CATALOG` / `LEGACY_ADAPTER_RULES` precedent
 * from issue #2029. It lives under `scripts/` — NOT `src/` — so it can never
 * drift into the plugin bundle or the initialization path (AGENTS.md
 * invariants 1 and 2 are not touched by construction).
 *
 * Every row names a durable stream family on `main` @ `79fbf3ae` (the
 * fresh-main tree the 8+1-lane localization sweep verified; see the issue
 * trace). Line citations were verified against that tree and are
 * ungated — treat them as "verified as of" pointers, not standing
 * guarantees (the same caveat `docs/observability-event-contract.md` §6
 * carries). The mechanical guarantees are the writer-module coverage
 * ratchet and the disposition rules in the check script.
 *
 * Disposition rules (issue #2036): every row must end in exactly one of
 *   - fix-in-issue  — a linked implementation issue in the #2029–#2051
 *                     sequence, or sequence-amendment issue #2309;
 *   - retain-by-design — citing the authoritative durability/lifecycle
 *                     requirement plus bounded reader/close proof;
 *   - not-a-defect    — citing the source proof (bounded queue, batch-scoped
 *                     artifact, or hard byte bound).
 * `defer` / `unknown` / `TBD` / "future issue" are not completed rows and
 * fail the check.

The GLOBAL deleter is a directory scan, not a per-plan hook — /swarm close readdirs .swarm/ and matches every /^post-mortem-[^/\\\\]+\\.md$/ name (src/commands/close/archive-stage.ts:351-375), copies each into the archive, records it in ctx.archivedActiveStateFiles, and then unlinks each matched artifact from .swarm/ (src/commands/close/clean-stage.ts:155-174). Because the sweep is driven by the directory listing rather than by a known set of plan ids, it reclaims keys the writer never told it about. CAVEAT: the unlink runs only for artifacts that archived successfully — src/commands/close/clean-stage.ts:45-79 deliberately preserves active state when nothing was archived — and the trigger is session close, so an unclosed session retains one report per plan.',
