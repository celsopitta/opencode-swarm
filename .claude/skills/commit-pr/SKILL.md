# Commit & PR Protocol

## Graph-first evidence contract

Before publication, use `repo_map` `diff_context` and `impact_cone` as a final drift check, then verify the direct source, Git diff, and tests. Graph evidence is advisory only. If freshness is stale or inconclusive, confidence is low, source is missing, the language is unsupported/dynamic, the graph is absent, or an action fails, publication decisions rely on the direct evidence.

Follow every step in order. Do not skip steps.

## Step -1 - Mandatory invariant audit

Before any build, test, push, or PR action, read:

1. [`../../../AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md)
2. [`../../../docs/engineering-invariants.md`](../../../docs/engineering-invariants.md)

For every touched invariant, prepare concrete evidence for the PR body. The PR body must include:

```md
## Invariant audit
- 1 (plugin init): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 2 (runtime portability): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 3 (subprocesses): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 4 (.swarm containment): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 5 (plan durability): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 6 (test_runner safety): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 7 (test writing): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 8 (session state): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 9 (guardrails/retry): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 10 (chat/system msg): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 11 (tool registration): touched / not touched - <evidence>
- 12 (release/cache): touched / not touched - <evidence>
```

If a touched invariant cannot be proven from source and test output, do not push.

### Required validations for touched invariants

If invariants 1, 2, or 3 are touched, run all three:

```bash
bun run build
node scripts/repro-704.mjs
node --input-type=module -e "await import('./dist/index.js'); console.log('dist import OK')"
```

If invariant 3 is touched, audit changed source files for subprocess use:

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | xargs -r grep -nE "bunSpawn\(|spawn\(|spawnSync\(" || true
```

If invariant 11 is touched, run:

```bash
bun --smol test tests/unit/config --timeout 60000
for f in tests/unit/tools/*.test.ts; do bun --smol test "$f" --timeout 30000; done
```

If invariant 7 is touched, confirm the writing-tests skill was loaded and that new test seams avoid leaking `mock.module`.

## Step 0 - Session start hygiene

Run before publication work:

```bash
git fetch origin main
rm -f .swarm/evidence/pr_body.md
rm -f .swarm/evidence/commit-pr-validation.md
rm -f .swarm/evidence/publication-evidence.json
git status --short
```

Delete ONLY those three exact publication-cache files. NEVER broad-delete
`.swarm/evidence/*.json` — that directory also holds authoritative task/gate
evidence (`{taskId}.json`), `final-council.json`, and phase-council records
(issue #2131 finding 4a).

On Windows, prefer temporary save branches over `git stash`. If you must stash, use `git stash push --include-untracked` and verify the stash contents.

If this changeset edited any SKILL.md file's wording, also run `file:.swarm/bundled-skills/skill-edit-validation/SKILL.md`'s content-assertion sweep before committing, to catch stale test assertions.

## Step 1 - Commit and PR titles

Use conventional commit format `<type>(<scope>): <description>` exactly.

- description is lowercase and does not end with a period
- allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `build`

Choose the PR title type by the main change:

- new capability -> `feat`
- bug fix only -> `fix`
- docs or chore only -> non-bump types

The squash merge commit message must match the PR title exactly.

> **Note:** The PR title MUST follow `<type>(<scope>): <description>` exactly — CI runs `action-semantic-pull-request` which will fail the `check-title` job if the format is wrong. Do not deviate from this format.

## Step 2 - Release note fragment

Create a pending release fragment and do not calculate a version manually.

Required file shape:

```text
docs/releases/pending/<unique-slug>.md
```

The fragment should cover:

- what changed
- why
- migration steps, if any
- breaking changes, if any
- known caveats

#### Ground-truth verification (mandatory)

Before finalizing a release note fragment, verify every concrete reference
against the actual codebase:

- **File paths**: `grep -r "path/to/file"` — confirm each referenced file
  exists at the stated path.
- **Script names**: check `package.json` scripts or `scripts/` directory.
- **Attribute/variable names**: grep for the exact identifier in `src/`.
- **Environment variables**: grep for the exact name in `src/` and config.

Remove or correct any reference that does not resolve. AI-generated
fragments frequently hallucinate paths and names — this step is not
optional.

Bot authors (e.g. `[bot]`, Copilot) and docs/workflow/meta-only changes (no `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `package.json`, etc.) are exempt from this requirement by CI; all other PRs that touch code must include a fragment.

Do not manually edit:

- `package.json` version
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.release-please-manifest.json` — exception: reconciliation when the manifest desyncs from actual releases (see below)

For the full release-please manifest desync diagnosis and fix protocol, read `references/pr-incident-playbook.md`.

## Step 3 - Mandatory validation suite

Run the full validation stack before pushing. The exact commands may be narrowed only when the repo contract or current task explicitly justifies it in evidence, not by intuition.

### Pre-flight

`dist/` is not committed (#1047) — do not stage it. Confirm the build succeeds:

```bash
bun run build
node --input-type=module -e "await import('./dist/index.js'); console.log('dist import OK')"
```

### Tier 1 - quality

Run both linter AND formatter — e.g., `bunx @biomejs/biome@<version> check --write .` or equivalent — because CI quality gates reject code that passes tests but fails style validation. **Pin the tool version** to match the version in `package.json` (`@biomejs/biome`); unversioned `bunx biome` resolves to a different version than the CI gate uses. (the repo script `bun run lint:ci` runs the pinned Biome version; prefer it over invoking `bunx biome` directly).

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run lint:ci
bun run scripts/check-tool-registration.ts
bun run check:mock-cleanup
bun run check:invariants
bun run check:cross-contamination
bun run check:test-clock
bun run check:runtime-src-refs
bun run check:events
bun run check:retention
bun run check:registry-citations
bun run check:core-events
bun run check:shell-audit
bun run check:trajectory-store
bun run check:test-file-cap
bun run scripts/check-vacuous-assertions.ts
bun run check:pending-fragment
bun run check:gate-portability
bun run check:bare-spawn
bun run scripts/check-config-consumption.ts
bun run check:test-tmpdir
bun run check:bash-portability
bun run check:error-channel-discard
bun run check:path-identity
bun run check:token-formula
(cd scripts/swarm-model && node --test)
bun run package:smoke
```

The CI quality job also fails closed when either required dependency is not
successful before running the expensive checks:

```bash
if [[ "$DETECT_RELEASE_RESULT" != "success" || "$RELEASE_OWNER_RESULT" != "success" ]]; then
  echo "::error::required dependency failed: detect-release=$DETECT_RELEASE_RESULT, release-owner-guard=$RELEASE_OWNER_RESULT"
  exit 1
fi
```

This list is the FULL blocking CI quality contract (issue #2131 finding 4c):
every quality-job step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` plus the `package:smoke`
pack check. `tests/unit/skills/commit-pr-validation-parity.test.ts` derives the
list from the workflow — if CI adds a quality step, the parity test fails until
this skill teaches it.

### Tier 2 - unit tests

```bash
bun run test:unit:ci               # CI-equivalent unit gate (quarantine ledgers + retry budget)
bun run test:unit:ci <file>...     # scoped mode: run only the listed repo-relative test files
```

`bun run test:unit:ci` runs `scripts/ci/run-unit-tests-local.ts`, the CI-equivalent unit gate with per-platform quarantine ledgers (`scripts/ci/quarantined-tests.txt`, `quarantined-tests-macos.txt`, `quarantined-tests-windows.txt`) and the retry budget. The full serial run is 45–90 min, so use the scoped mode (`bun run test:unit:ci <file>...`) when the evidence justifies narrowing (e.g. you only touched one module). This closes the gap the hand-rolled loops left (~40% of CI's colocated `src/**` tests were uncovered).

### Tier 3 - integration

```bash
bun test tests/integration ./test --timeout 120000
```

### Tier 4 - security and adversarial

```bash
bun test tests/security --timeout 120000
bun test tests/adversarial --timeout 120000
```

### Tier 5 - smoke

```bash
bun test tests/smoke --timeout 120000
```

### Pre-existing failure handling

If a failure looks unrelated, prove it on clean `origin/main` before carrying it into the PR body:

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/repro-check origin/main
cd /tmp/repro-check
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun --smol test <repo-relative-path-to-failing-test> --timeout 120000
cd ..
git worktree remove /tmp/repro-check
```

If the failure reproduces on `main`, document it under `## Pre-existing failures`. Do not silently inherit it.

### dist/ is generated, not committed

`dist/` is build output and is git-ignored (#1047); do **not** stage or commit it, and
there is no `dist-check` drift gate. The authoritative artifact check is `package-check`,
which runs `npm pack` and verifies the packed tarball is complete (type declarations,
grammar assets), installs it in a temp project, imports it under Node, and runs the CLI.

A `package-check` failure is a source / build / `package.json#files` problem — fix the
source or manifest and rebuild; never "commit dist to make CI green." CI builds `dist/`
itself (the `unit`, `package-check`, and `smoke` jobs run `bun run build`), and
release/publish builds from source.

## Step 4 - Workflow changes

If any `.github/workflows/*.yml` file changed, every third-party `uses:` must be pinned to a full 40-character SHA.

## Step 5 - History shape

Before opening a PR, verify no local-only files are staged:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD origin/main | grep -E '\.(local\.json|vscode|idea)' || true
```

Prefer a single clean commit for the branch before initial PR publication. Resolve the canonical remote first (see "Canonical remote resolution" below), then squash/push:

```bash
git fetch <canonical-remote> <base-branch>
git log --oneline <canonical-remote>/<base-branch>..HEAD
git reset --soft <canonical-remote>/<base-branch>
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
git push --force-with-lease -u <canonical-remote> <branch-name>
```

If a review cycle is already active and inline comments depend on current SHAs, avoid resquashing until threads are resolved.

If pushing to a PR branch owned by another agent or bot, push to the PR's actual head branch:

```powershell
$prBranch = gh pr view <number> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName'
git fetch <canonical-remote> $prBranch
git push <canonical-remote> "<your-local-branch>:$prBranch" --force-with-lease
```

### Fork PR workflow approval

If the PR is from a fork (head repository differs from base repository), GitHub requires explicit workflow approval after every push. CI jobs will remain in "waiting" status until approved:

```bash
# List pending runs
gh run list --repo <upstream-owner>/<upstream-repo> --branch <branch-name> --limit 5

# Approve the pending run
gh api -X POST repos/<upstream-owner>/<upstream-repo>/actions/runs/<run-id>/approve
```

This requires `actions: write` permission on the base repository. See the `fork-pr-operations` skill for the full protocol including race conditions, permission requirements, and stale CI verification.

### Pre-push: Push Protection and Canonical Remote

Before `git push`, run both checks:

1. **Push protection scan** — scan for literal secret patterns that trigger GitHub push protection:
   ```bash
   git log origin/main..HEAD -p | grep -E 'sk_live|ghp_|xox[abprs]-|AKIA|eyJ|AIza' || true
   ```
2. **Canonical remote resolution** — push to the canonical-org remote, not a personal fork:
   ```bash
   git remote -v   # identify the org-owned remote
   git push -u <canonical-remote> <branch>
   ```

For full details, patterns, workarounds, and anecdotes, read `references/pr-incident-playbook.md`.

## Step 6 - PR creation

Before generating the PR body, read `.swarm/issue-reference.json`. If it exists and
contains a `number` field, auto-populate `Closes #<number>` as the first line of the
PR body. If the file does not exist, fall back to the `Closes #<issue-number>` placeholder.

PR body requirements:

- `Closes #<issue-number>` as the first line when the PR resolves an issue
- `## Summary`
- `## Invariant audit`
- `## Test plan`

CI enforces both the section ORDER (Summary, then Invariant audit, then Test plan) and that each heading is on its own line with nothing trailing but whitespace (see `.github/workflows/pr-standards.yml`).

### Publication-gate evidence

A repository publication gate (`.github/hooks/pr-publication-gate.json` ->
`scripts/copilot-pr-publication-gate.sh`) may block `gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`,
and `gh pr ready` until publication evidence exists. Before publishing, write:

- `.swarm/evidence/pr_body.md` — the exact PR body you will publish (must contain
  `## Summary`, `## Invariant audit`, and `## Test plan`).
- `.swarm/evidence/commit-pr-validation.md` — the validation commands you ran and
  their results.
- `.swarm/evidence/publication-evidence.json` — the versioned, freshness-bound
  receipt (issue #2131 finding 4b). The gate verifies it against the CURRENT git
  state and the EXACT body being published:

  ```bash
  BODY_SHA256=$(sha256sum .swarm/evidence/pr_body.md | cut -d' ' -f1)
  cat > .swarm/evidence/publication-evidence.json <<EOF
  {
    "schema_version": 1,
    "state": "validated",
    "repository": "$(git remote get-url origin)",
    "head_sha": "$(git rev-parse HEAD)",
    "body_sha256": "$BODY_SHA256",
    "validation_commands": ["bun run typecheck", "bun run lint:ci"],
    "recorded_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  }
  EOF
  ```

  `pr_number` may be added once the PR exists (for `gh pr edit` / `gh pr ready`).
  If HEAD changes, the body is edited, or you rerun validation, REGENERATE this
  receipt — a stale or mismatched receipt is rejected by the gate.

These files live under `.swarm/` (runtime state, never committed) and double as the
evidence the gate checks. Keep them current if you edit the PR body or rerun
validation. The CI `pr-standards` check enforces the same body contract server-side.

PowerShell-safe pattern:

```powershell
$refPath = ".swarm/issue-reference.json"
$closesLine = if ((Test-Path $refPath) -and ($ref = Get-Content $refPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json) -and $ref.number) {
    "Closes #$($ref.number)"
} else {
    "Closes #<issue-number>"
}
$body = @"
$closesLine

## Summary
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

## Invariant audit
- 1 (plugin init): not touched - <evidence>

## Test plan
- [ ] <validation item>
"@
$utf8NoBom = New-Object -TypeName System.Text.UTF8Encoding -ArgumentList $false
$prBodyPath = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "pr_body.txt"
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($prBodyPath, $body, $utf8NoBom)
gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body-file $prBodyPath --base main
```

### Issue-trace publication receipt
If this session is running an issue trace (`/swarm issue --trace`), call
`record_issue_publication` with the issue number, PR number, URL, and HEAD sha immediately
after `gh pr create` (or after `gh pr edit` / `gh pr ready` for an existing PR).
This is what lets the issue-trace workflow reach its terminal `published` state —
without it the trace stays at `publication_handoff` and is NOT considered resolved.

## Step 6a - PR monitoring subscription

After PR creation, if the project uses PR monitoring (`pr_monitor.enabled: true`
in resolved opencode-swarm config), the new PR must be subscribed for background
monitoring:

- **Automatic (default):** when `pr_monitor.auto_subscribe_on_pr_create` is
  enabled (default `true`), the subscription is created automatically after
  `gh pr create` succeeds — no command needed. Verify with `/swarm pr status`
  if in doubt.
- **Manual fallback:** when auto-subscribe is disabled or did not fire, run
  `/swarm pr subscribe <pr-url>`, which records the subscription and
  lazy-starts the polling worker.

The post-subscription monitoring protocol — event intake, triage
(fix / ask / skip), bounded-retry escalation, and terminal-state behavior —
lives in the swarm-pr-subscribe skill (`../swarm-pr-subscribe/SKILL.md`).

## Step 6.5 - Issue comment

If the PR closes an issue, post a comment on the issue. This is mandatory.

The issue comment must include:

1. the PR link
2. what changed
3. how to use it
4. migration steps or "No migration required"

Uses the same UTF-8-no-BOM file-write pattern as Step 6 above.

````powershell
$comment = @"
Fixed in PR #<pr-number>.

## What changed
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

## How to use
```json
{ "config": "example" }
```

## Migration
No migration required.
"@
$utf8NoBom = New-Object -TypeName System.Text.UTF8Encoding -ArgumentList $false
$issueCommentPath = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "issue-comment.txt"
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($issueCommentPath, $comment, $utf8NoBom)
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body-file $issueCommentPath
````

If the PR merged before this was done, post the missing issue comment immediately.

## Commit messages

PowerShell parens/brackets/backticks/dollar-signs in `git commit -m "..."` fail. Use the same UTF-8-no-BOM file-write pattern (see Step 6), then `git commit -F <file>`.

## Step 7 - Existing PR follow-up and closeout

If a PR already exists for the branch:

1. do not open a second PR
2. inspect unresolved PR feedback surfaces before updating or readying the PR: review threads/comments, requested-changes reviews, CI/check failures, mergeability/conflicts, and whether check data belongs to the current head SHA
3. use `../swarm-pr-feedback/SKILL.md` when feedback needs fixes before closeout
4. update the existing PR body when summary, invariant evidence, test counts, caveats, or pre-existing failure notes changed
5. keep the PR draft while follow-up edits are still expected or required checks are still pending
6. mark the PR ready only after the body is current and required remote checks are green, unless the user explicitly wants it ready earlier
7. after any follow-up push or force-push, verify the PR head matches the expected commit and that reported checks belong to the current `headRefOid`:

```powershell
gh pr view <number> --json headRefOid,body,isDraft,state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,url
```

Useful commands:

```powershell
gh pr edit <number> --body-file "$env:TEMP\pr_body.txt"
gh pr ready <number>
gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast
```

### Conflict closeout

After resolving merge conflicts or syncing a stale branch:

1. verify there are no local unmerged paths or conflict markers,
2. push the conflict-resolution commit,
3. verify GitHub reports both `mergeable: MERGEABLE` and
   `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`, not merely that local markers are gone, and
4. keep a conflict/branch-drift item in the PR closure ledger when it affected
   the PR.

If GitHub still reports `DIRTY`, `BLOCKED`, or stale checks after local conflict
resolution, fetch current `origin/main` again and re-evaluate before claiming the
conflict is resolved.

### GitHub auto-merge race condition

With a merge queue enabled, prefer queuing over manual freshness rebases. If you encounter "fetch first" errors after a fresh fetch, GitHub may have auto-pushed a merge commit. Recovery: force-push your local commit with `--force-with-lease`. See `references/pr-incident-playbook.md` for full diagnosis and recovery steps.

### Check closeout

`gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast` is useful but can lag or flatten matrix and
downstream jobs. When the PR checks view looks stale, missing, or inconsistent,
use the workflow run as the authoritative detail:

> **MCP environments:** When using GitHub MCP tools instead of `gh`, prefer
> `get_check_runs` over `get_status`. The `get_status` method uses GitHub's
> legacy commit status API: it returns `state: "pending"` even when all GitHub
> Actions jobs are green, because Actions creates check-runs (not legacy
> statuses). `get_check_runs` returns the actual job results.

```powershell
gh run view <run-id> --json headSha,status,conclusion,jobs,url
```

Keep watching after unit jobs pass; this repository may enqueue integration and
smoke jobs later in the same CI run. Do not call the PR green until the current
`headRefOid` has all required jobs completed successfully.

If a previous run from an older PR head is still in progress or already failed
and is blocking the current head's workflow through concurrency, inspect it with
`gh run view <run-id> --json headSha,status,conclusion,jobs,url`. Cancel only
obsolete older-head runs that are no longer relevant to the PR head you are
validating, then wait for the current-head checks to complete.

If you edit the PR body after checks are green, expect PR Standards / title
checks to rerun. Re-check before claiming final green or merge-readiness.

### Merge queue (current-base validation)

Read `file:.swarm/bundled-skills/merge-queue-readiness/SKILL.md` for the full pre-queue merge-group CI simulation protocol.

When `main` has a GitHub **merge queue** enabled, do not rebase or force-push a PR
*solely because `main` advanced*. Once required checks and review are green, add the
PR to the merge queue; GitHub re-runs the required workflows against the queued
change on top of the latest `main` (and any earlier queued PRs) before merging, so
manual "freshness" rebases are unnecessary.

Still rebase/force-push when there is a **real** reason: a genuine merge conflict,
a stale review thread that depends on current SHAs, or a correctness issue that only
appears against current `main`. The queue handles up-to-date validation; it does not
resolve conflicts for you.

Required workflows trigger on both `pull_request` and `merge_group`. PR-only checks
(title/body validation) no-op to success on `merge_group` because the PR already
satisfied them before being queued.

## Step 8 - Cancelled jobs and skipped dependents

If a required GitHub Actions job is `cancelled` and downstream jobs are `skipped`:

1. inspect the run:

```powershell
gh run view <run-id> --json status,conclusion,jobs,url
```

2. if the cancellation looks like orchestration or infrastructure rather than a code failure, rerun the failed or cancelled jobs:

```powershell
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

3. re-check the PR until required jobs are green:

```powershell
gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast
```

Do not call the PR green or merge-ready while a required job is `cancelled`, `skipped`, `in_progress`, or otherwise non-green unless the user explicitly accepts that state.

## Step 9 - Pre-merge checklist

- [ ] invariant audit is complete and current
- [ ] required build and validation commands ran for touched invariants
- [ ] `test_runner` was not used with broad repo-validation scopes
- [ ] release fragment exists and version files are untouched
- [ ] `dist/` was NOT staged (it is generated output, not committed — #1047)
- [ ] PR body has `Closes`, `## Summary`, `## Invariant audit`, and `## Test plan`
- [ ] if this was review follow-up, the PR body was refreshed to match current evidence
- [ ] if the PR resolves an issue, the issue comment was posted with PR link, what changed, how to use it, and migration notes
- [ ] if any required job was cancelled and dependent jobs skipped, the run was rerun or the non-green state was explicitly accepted by the user
- [ ] for high-risk work (security, isolation, IPC, auth, payments, migrations), an independent adversarial review subagent ran before the final substantive push and all confirmed findings were addressed — if this was not done before pushing, run the review now and force-push a corrected commit before marking the PR ready
- [ ] all required CI checks are green before calling the PR merge-ready
