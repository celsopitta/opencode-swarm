## End-to-end PR workflow

This is the complete sequence for getting code from your branch to an npm release. Every step matters — skipping one breaks the pipeline downstream.

### 1. Set up your branch

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>   # e.g. feat/add-retry-backoff
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

> **`dist/` is generated, not committed** (#1047). The plugin entry (`package.json#main`
> → `dist/index.js`) only exists after a build. `bun install` builds it automatically via
> the `prepare` script, so a fresh clone is runnable. If you load the plugin from this
> checkout and pull source changes **without** re-running `bun install`, refresh the bundle
> with `bun run build` (or `bun run dev`, which builds then launches OpenCode) before the
> plugin will load. The build is cross-platform (bun + tsc, no OS-specific steps).

### 2. Make your changes

- Write code, tests, and docs
- Follow the commit message format below for every commit
- Follow the test rules in `.opencode/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` (bun:test only, mock isolation, cross-platform paths)
- If you change behavior guarded by existing tests, **update those tests in the same PR**

### 3. Write a pending release-note fragment

**Every PR with a user-visible change MUST add a unique fragment at `docs/releases/pending/<descriptive-slug>.md`.** Do NOT compute the next version, do NOT create `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, and do NOT write to a shared `unreleased.md` — release-please picks the version and the release workflow aggregates pending fragments at release time. See the "Release notes" section below for what each fragment should contain.

### 4. Run all checks locally

```bash
# Tier 1 — quality (must pass before anything else)
bun run typecheck
bunx biome ci .

# Tier 2 — unit tests (all platforms in CI; run locally on yours)
# For directories with mock conflicts, use per-file loops:
for f in tests/unit/tools/*.test.ts; do bun --smol test "$f" --timeout 30000; done
# CI also isolates hook files per file because several hooks share mutable mocks:
for f in src/hooks/*.test.ts tests/unit/hooks/*.test.ts; do bun --smol test "$f" --timeout 30000; done
# For directories without known mock conflicts, batch is fine:
bun --smol test tests/unit/cli tests/unit/commands tests/unit/config --timeout 120000

# Tier 3 — integration tests
bun test tests/integration ./test --timeout 120000

# Tier 4 — security and adversarial tests
bun test tests/security --timeout 120000
bun test tests/adversarial --timeout 120000

# Tier 5 — build + smoke (smoke tests require a successful build first)
bun run build
bun test tests/smoke --timeout 120000
```

### Canonical repository-validation command (issue #2675)

The CI-equivalent entry point is the shared, bounded repository-validation
authority. It runs every supported surface in inventory order and persists a
schema-versioned report under `.swarm/`:

```bash
# Complete repository matrix
bun run validate:repo -- --mode full --diff-base origin/main

# Changed-work matrix; no discovered work reports no_op, not passed
bun run validate:repo -- --mode diff --diff-base origin/main
```

In diff mode, selection is based on committed branch changes in
`<diff-base>...HEAD`; unstaged and untracked work is excluded. The complete inventory is:
`quality`, `unit`, `integration`, `security`,
`coverage`, `memory-recall-regression`, `package-check`, `smoke`,
`php-validation`, and `rust-sandbox-runner`. Each report has
`schemaVersion: 1`, runtime metadata (`bunVersion`, `platform`, `arch`), the
exact array-form command and cwd for each item, the `origin/main` diff base,
per-item terminal status, bounded output, timing, signal, and cleanup outcome.
Terminal statuses are `passed`, `failed`, `crashed`, `timed_out`, `missing`,
and `skipped`; a run containing an unresolved crash, timeout, missing item, or
skip is `incomplete` rather than a complete pass. Run-level statuses are
`passed`, `failed`, `incomplete`, and `no_op`, with `no_op` reserved for an
empty diff selection.

Use repeatable `--surface <name>` or comma-separated `--surfaces <name,...>`
for a deliberate subset; omitting both runs the full ten-surface matrix. An
unavailable required runtime produces a `skipped` item with a reason and an
`incomplete` run (nonzero exit), including in full-matrix mode; missing tools
must not be reported as a pass.

Validation bounds are fixed by default at 120000 ms for each test process,
180000 ms per item, 900000 ms for the whole run, and 65536 bytes per output
channel after redaction. Test argv uses the keepalive preload
`scripts/ci/bun-32056-keepalive.ts`, and file paths remain individual argv
tokens so quoted or spaced paths are reproduced exactly.

The historical `659/3,389` count is an unconfirmed historical count: the raw
per-item output and provenance were not retained, so that figure cannot be
used as current reproducible evidence. New validation reports retain the
bounded raw evidence needed to distinguish pass, failure, crash, timeout,
missing, and skip.

Fix any failures before proceeding. If a test failure is pre-existing and unrelated to your changes, note it in the PR description but do not skip the other tiers.

### 5. Push and open a PR

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points explaining what and why>

## Test plan
- [ ] <what you tested>

EOF
)" --base main
```

The PR title is preserved in the merge commit and is what release-please
reads. It must follow the conventional commit format exactly (see below). The
`pr-standards` CI check enforces this.

### 6. Wait for CI

All checks must be green before merging. See the "CI checks" section below for the full list.

### 7. Merge the PR

`main` requires a GitHub merge queue (repository ruleset, `merge_method: MERGE`) — once required checks and review are green, add the PR to the merge queue rather than merging directly; GitHub re-validates and merges it as a two-parent merge commit, not a squash. The PR title is preserved as the merge commit's body (GitHub's default merge-commit template: `Merge pull request #N from <branch>` subject, PR title as body), which is what release-please reads — do not assume a squash-commit history when working with `git log`.

### 8. What happens automatically after merge

1. `release-please` runs and creates (or updates) a release PR (e.g. `chore(main): release 6.41.0`)
2. The `update-pr-notes` job prepends your `docs/releases/` file to the release PR body (preserving release-please markers — see "How releases work" below)
3. When someone merges the release PR, release-please creates a git tag + GitHub Release, and the `publish-npm` job publishes to npm automatically

**Do not manually create tags, releases, or run `npm publish`.** The pipeline handles everything.

---

## How releases work

This repository uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (`release-type: node`) to automate versioning, changelog generation, and npm publishing. The entire release pipeline is driven **exclusively by commit messages and PR titles**. There is no manual versioning step.

When a PR is merged to `main`:
1. `release-please` reads every commit message merged since the last release tag
2. It determines the next semver version bump based on conventional commit types
3. It creates or updates a "release PR" that bumps `package.json`, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, and updates `.release-please-manifest.json`
4. When that release PR is merged, it creates a git tag + GitHub Release and publishes to npm

**If your commit messages are malformed, release-please will either ignore your changes in the changelog or produce the wrong version bump.** There is no recovery path other than a follow-up fix commit.

### Critical: release-please PR body markers

release-please identifies its own PRs by parsing markers in the PR body (the `:robot: I have created a release` header and structured changelog). **Never replace the entire body of a release PR.** The `update-pr-notes` CI job aggregates pending release-note fragments from every PR referenced in the release-please PR body and inserts the combined content inside a stable `<!-- custom-release-notes:start -->` … `<!-- custom-release-notes:end -->` marker block — release-please's own markers must remain intact below it. Same flow runs against the GitHub Release body after a tag is cut via `update-release-notes`. The implementation is `scripts/release-notes-fragments.mjs`.

### What release-please manages automatically — do not touch manually

- `package.json` → `version` field
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.release-please-manifest.json`

If you manually edit any of these files in a PR, release-please will conflict with itself on the next run. Leave them alone.

---

## Commit message format (Conventional Commits)

Every commit **and every PR title** must follow this format exactly:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
```

- The description must be lowercase and not end with a period
- The type must be one of the allowed types below
- Scope is optional but encouraged for clarity

### Allowed types and their semver effect

| Type | Changelog section | Version bump |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | Features | **minor** (e.g. 6.30.1 → 6.31.0) |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes | **patch** (e.g. 6.30.1 → 6.30.2) |
| `perf` | Performance Improvements | **patch** |
| `revert` | Reverts | **patch** |
| `docs` | Documentation | none (not included in changelog) |
| `chore` | — | none (not included in changelog) |
| `refactor` | — | none (not included in changelog) |
| `test` | — | none (not included in changelog) |
| `ci` | — | none (not included in changelog) |
| `build` | — | none (not included in changelog) |

> **Note:** Types that produce "none" version bump (`docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `build`) will not trigger a release on their own. If your PR only contains these types, release-please will not create a release PR until a bump-producing commit (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert`) is merged.

### Breaking changes → major bump

To trigger a **major** version bump (e.g. 6.30.1 → 7.0.0), add a footer to the commit body:

```
feat: redesign swarm orchestration API

BREAKING CHANGE: SwarmConfig.agents field renamed to SwarmConfig.workers
```

Or append `!` to the type:

```
feat!: redesign swarm orchestration API
```

### Valid examples

```
feat(architect): add retry backoff to SME delegation
fix(circuit-breaker): prevent race condition on concurrent invocations
perf(plan-sync): reduce lock contention in worker handoff
docs: update getting-started guide for bun 1.2
chore: bump @opencode-ai/sdk to 1.1.54
test(gate): add adversarial coverage for evidence summary init
ci: add tiered test pipeline and PR quality checks
refactor(swarm): extract phase orchestration into dedicated module
```

### Invalid examples (will be rejected by `pr-standards` CI check)

```
WIP
fix stuff
Update README
feat: Add new feature.        ← trailing period
Feat: new feature             ← uppercase type
feature: new thing            ← not an allowed type
```

---

## PR title requirement

The PR title is used by release-please as the merge commit message (see "Merge the PR" above — `main` uses a required merge queue, not a squash merge). **It must follow the same conventional commit format as individual commits.** The `pr-standards` CI check will block merging if the title is invalid.

Choose the type that matches the **primary change** in the PR:
- New capability → `feat`
- Bug fix or correctness fix → `fix`
- Mixed feat + fix → use `feat` (minor bump subsumes patch)

---

## What CI checks must pass before merging

The protected `main` ruleset currently requires the exact contexts recorded in
the [machine-readable required-check contract](scripts/required-check-contract.json)
and its [fresh external evidence](docs/ci/required-check-evidence.json). That
contract is the live required set; it is not a claim that every workflow job or
matrix cell runs on every pull request.

| Live required context(s) | What it validates |
|---|---|
| `quality` | TypeScript compiles (`tsc --noEmit`), Biome lint + format clean |
| `unit (ubuntu-latest, 1)` through `unit (ubuntu-latest, 4)` | Required Ubuntu unit-test shards |
| `unit-passed` | Aggregate of the `unit` matrix (additional platform cells are event- or path-scoped) |
| `security` | Security and adversarial tests pass |
| `package-check` | Package metadata and publishable artifact checks pass |
| `integration` (Ubuntu) | Integration tests pass (circuit breakers, gate workflows, state machines) |
| `smoke (ubuntu-latest)`, `smoke (macos-latest)`, `smoke (windows-latest)` | Package builds successfully and smoke tests pass on each required platform |
| `php-validation` | PHP language/build fixtures and validation tests pass |
| `rust-sandbox-runner` | Rust sandbox runner builds and validates |
| `check-title` and `pr-standards` | PR title and standards checks pass |
| `coverage` (merge queue only) | Code coverage ≥ 65.00% over the merged union of the 6-way `coverage-shard` matrix (issue #2341; fail-closed if any shard report is missing) |

The `unit` and `smoke` rows expand into event- and path-scoped matrix cells;
`coverage` is merge-group scoped. `release-owner-guard` is a dependency helper
for the required `quality` context, not a standalone required context.
`check-duplicates` is a non-required helper. The local `drift` workflow now
declares `pull_request`, `push` to `main`, and `merge_group: checks_requested`,
but `drift` remains an intended context until the live ruleset is promoted;
the checker reports that pre-promotion divergence as a visible nonblocking
notice. See [required-check contract details](docs/ci-required-check-contract.md).

Every user-visible PR (`src/`, `package.json`, workflows, shipped skills) still
adds a `docs/releases/pending/<slug>.md` fragment — release-please aggregates
fragments into the release notes, so a missing fragment means the PR ships with
no notes. Escape hatch: `FRAGMENT_CHECK_ENFORCE=0` (soft-warn). Release-please
branches are exempt.

**Do not ask for a merge if any check is red.** Fix the issue first.

The `quality` job also runs `bun run check:mock-cleanup` which enforces:
- All `mock.module` calls have proper cleanup (`afterEach(mock.restore())` or file-scoped `mockClear`/`mockReset`)
- All `mock.module('node:*', ...)` calls spread real exports (e.g., `...realFs`) to prevent test pollution

The same job runs `bun run check:invariants` Check 4 (issue #1666): the `scripts/mock-allowlist.txt` allowlist is closed against unapproved growth. Adding a new `mock.module` target requires a matching standalone marker line `# APPROVED-NEW: <normalized-target>` in `scripts/mock-allowlist.txt` (preserved across regen by `scripts/generate-mock-allowlist.sh`). `MOCK_ALLOWLIST_ENFORCE=0` soft-warns for a deliberate growth PR. Prefer the `_internals` DI seam for new code — the allowlist is legacy debt, not a bypass.

Before pushing, run `bun run check:pre-push`. This cross-platform package
entrypoint hard-enforces repository drift and then validates retention-registry
citations; it is the local equivalent of those two CI authorities.

---

## Test rules

### Test framework

All tests use `bun:test`. Do not use Jest, Vitest, or any other framework. See `.opencode/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` for the full guide including mock isolation rules and cross-platform requirements.

### Test directory map

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/` | Pure logic tests, no I/O, fast (<5s total) |
| `tests/integration/` | Multi-component tests, orchestration flows, state machine transitions |
| `tests/smoke/` | Post-build packaging verification — does the built artifact actually work? |
| `tests/security/` | Adversarial inputs, injection attempts, CI security invariants |
| `tests/adversarial/` | Extended adversarial scenarios for swarm-specific attack surfaces |
| `tests/architect/` | Architect agent behavior and identity tests |
| `test/` | Top-level standalone tests (adversarial plan write, reviewer tiers, agent tagging) |

### Test file size limits

- **Maximum 500 lines per test file** (FR-006 SC-006.1), enforced by `scripts/check-test-file-cap.ts` as a diff-scoped ratchet (new over-cap files and grown over-cap files fail CI; pre-existing violators are non-blocking). Escape hatch: `TEST_CAP_ENFORCE=0` soft-warns. The config-consumption ratchet (`scripts/check-config-consumption.ts`, issue #2904) has the same escape hatch: `CONFIG_CONSUMPTION_ENFORCE=0` soft-warns for a deliberate declaration-growth PR. Verify locally on any platform — Windows PowerShell included — with `bun run check:test-file-cap` (fetch `origin/main` first; the check is diff-scoped and reads committed changes).
- `delegation-gate.test.ts` was the monolith — 2835 lines split into 45 focused files, each under 500 lines
- When a test file exceeds 500 lines, split it by behavior/feature into focused files
- SME tests (FR-008) use parameterization to keep files lean while maximizing coverage
- FR-010/011/012 hook tests (Phase 4) use shared fixture files (e.g., `curator-test-fixtures.ts`) to consolidate common setup and avoid duplication across focused test files

### When you change behavior, update the tests

If your code change alters the behavior of an existing function (new error messages, stricter validation, changed defaults), **find and update every test that asserts the old behavior.** Do not leave tests failing for a follow-up PR. Common examples:

- Adding `.strict()` to a Zod schema → tests asserting unknown fields are accepted must flip to rejected
- Adding `.int()` validation → tests asserting floats are accepted must flip to rejected
- Changing error handling from silent skip to structured error → tests asserting no output must assert the error
- Adding a new default field to a config schema → tests using `toEqual({...})` on config objects must include the new field

### Opt-in tool maps

Some tools are gated behind feature flags and use **opt-in tool maps** (e.g., `MEMORY_AGENT_TOOL_MAP` when `memory.enabled === true`, `EXTERNAL_SKILL_AGENT_TOOL_MAP` when `external_skills.curation_enabled === true`). These tools must still be fully registered (export, `TOOL_NAMES`, `tool-metadata`, manifest entry), but are merged into agent configs conditionally at build time. See AGENTS.md invariant #11 (Tool registration + agent-map coherence) for the complete checklist.

### Adding adversarial tests

Adversarial tests live in `tests/adversarial/` and verify security boundaries (FR-003 subprocess injection, FR-004 guardrail bypass, FR-005 evidence spoofing). Use the `_internals` DI seam pattern rather than `mock.module` to avoid cross-file mock leakage:

```typescript
// in tests/adversarial/evidence-spoofing.test.ts
import { _internals } from '../../src/hooks/knowledge-migrator';

const real = _internals.writeSentinel;
afterEach(() => { _internals.writeSentinel = real; });

test('evidence spoofing is blocked', () => {
  _internals.writeSentinel = mock(...) as typeof real;
  // assertions
});
```

For validating evidence integrity, use `src/evidence/manager.ts:_internals.validateEvidence` which is exposed for DI testing.

---

## Release notes (mandatory — no exceptions)

**Every PR with a user-visible change MUST add a pending fragment at `docs/releases/pending/<descriptive-slug>.md`.** This is not optional. This is not conditional on "user-facing changes" being polished. If your PR is merged without it, release-please publishes a generic changelog with no explanation of what changed or how to migrate.

> **Do NOT** calculate the next version, create `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, or write to a shared `unreleased.md`. release-please picks the version. The release workflow (`scripts/release-notes-fragments.mjs`) gathers every pending fragment from every PR included in the release-please release PR and inserts the combined content into a stable marker block in the release PR / GitHub Release body. Each PR owning its own unique file is what makes the previous merge-conflict hotspot go away.

### Where to put the fragment

- Path: `docs/releases/pending/<descriptive-slug>.md`
- Slug: short, kebab-case, descriptive of THIS change. Examples:
  - `docs/releases/pending/guardrails-transient-node-errors.md`
  - `docs/releases/pending/spec-drift-self-ack-guardrail.md`
  - `docs/releases/pending/phase-complete-durable-gate-proof.md`
- Pick a slug nobody else is likely to pick. Concurrent PRs each adding a *different* file produce zero merge conflicts.

### What to include

The fragment is freeform markdown. Cover:
- **What changed** — summarize the changes grouped by theme
- **Why** — the motivation (bug report, feature request, hardening)
- **Migration steps** — if any API, config, or behavior changed
- **Breaking changes** — if any (should be rare)
- **Known caveats** — anything users should watch out for

Do not prefix the heading with a version (`# v7.21.4`) — release-please owns the version. A descriptive `# <topic>` is the canonical header. See `docs/releases/v6.35.0.md` for the prose style; ignore the version prefix in that historical file.

### What still happens automatically

After your PR merges, release-please opens or updates its release PR. CI runs `scripts/release-notes-fragments.mjs update-pr` to aggregate every pending fragment referenced by that release PR and inject it inside the `<!-- custom-release-notes:start --> … <!-- custom-release-notes:end -->` marker block (preserving release-please's own body markers). When the release PR merges and a tag is cut, `update-release` mirrors the same aggregation into the GitHub Release body. A fragment's leading YAML frontmatter block (`---`-fenced, mapping-shaped) is treated as authoring metadata: it is stripped from the rendered release notes, while the provenance oracle keeps comparing the raw fragment bytes and accepts both the raw and the rendered published forms.

The tag job then prepares an exact-tag cleanup plan. It proves the remote
peeled tag, local peeled tag, and checkout HEAD are the same commit, binds the
full GitHub Release body and each consumed fragment's SHA-256, and passes that
plan to a fresh `main` checkout. The apply step runs with
`GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_REPOSITORY` step env (any step invoking a gh-dependent
fragment-script mode must carry them — enforced by
`tests/unit/scripts/ci/release-fragments-gh-auth-shape-2898.test.ts`), is
dry-run first, and writes
`docs/releases/v<version>.md` plus
`docs/releases/manifests/v<version>.json`; it deletes only a current pending
file whose raw bytes still equal the tagged bytes. Changed, renamed, missing,
ambiguous, unsafe, and unconsumed files are retained and reported. Repository
changes are proposed on a deterministic cleanup PR—never pushed to `main`.
Re-running the same tag is a no-op. Safety limits cap one fragment at 256 KiB,
one release at 1,000 candidate PRs and 5,000 fragment entries, historical
content matching at 64 MiB total, and recursive directory enumeration at 5,000
pending entries or 1,000 manifests; excess input fails closed before unbounded
reads or collection. For an old release whose PR linkage can no longer be resolved, an
exact unique match against the published marker block may recover tagged
fragments in source order. Its manifest records `prNumber: null` plus that
order; the immutable tag commit, raw-byte hashes, and complete release body
remain the authoritative provenance.

For historical reconstruction, first write an immutable oldest-to-newest tag
list as `{ "schemaVersion": 1, "tags": ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0"] }` in
`.release-fragment-cleanup/tags.json`. Run `prepare-historical-batch
--tags-file .release-fragment-cleanup/tags.json >
.release-fragment-cleanup/batch.json`; stdout is the reusable JSON batch while
diagnostics go to stderr. Process only the returned tags, and resume with its
non-null `nextCursor`. The cursor includes a SHA-256
binding to the complete ordered tag list, so deletion, insertion, or reordering
between batches fails closed instead of skipping work. Each batch is capped at 25
tags, the input is hard-capped at 1,000 tags, and invalid or oversized input
fails visibly rather than truncating. For each returned tag, check out that
exact tag oldest-to-newest and run
`prepare-cleanup --tag <tag> --out .release-fragment-cleanup/plan.json
--apply`. For every returned tag in every batch, including the batch whose
`nextCursor` is null, also pass
`--historical-batch .release-fragment-cleanup/batch.json`. The immutable plan
records the digest-bound ordered tag snapshot, exact slice, and continuation.
Both `prepare-cleanup` and `apply-cleanup` — the dry-run first, then the
explicit `--apply` form — validate an exact-tag proof that requires the
checkout HEAD to be the tag commit, so run them AT the tag checkout (a
detached worktree per batch; early historical tags predate the cleanup
feature, so overlay the current script without staging it, `git restore .`
before each tag-to-tag move, and restore
`docs/releases/manifests/historical-replay-state.json` before every tag
except the first of the whole ordered list). Cleanup-plan paths are
restricted to one JSON file
directly under `.release-fragment-cleanup/`. Existing matching history is
preserved; any conflict fails closed. The resulting `docs/releases` changes
(history, manifests, replay state, and deletion of exactly the
manifest-referenced pending fragments whose bytes still hash-match) are then
committed from a current main checkout as the batch PR. Commit each bounded batch as a cleanup
PR. Each non-final tag writes a version-controlled replay-state artifact so
required retention CI can verify that bounded work remains. That authorization
expires after seven days, reruns preserve its original deadline, and an expiry
beyond that fixed window is rejected, so
an abandoned/interrupted replay fails retention CI instead of suppressing the
limit indefinitely. The last tag of the final batch
removes that state and fails closed before mutation unless its projected pending
count satisfies the limit. The final batch has
`nextCursor: null`, and its last tag must satisfy `verify-retention`.
The drift workflow runs `verify-retention` to reject byte-identical consumed
fragments and to enforce the pending-fragment count limit, reporting the
14-day add rate and projected days-to-limit (with a `::warning::` under 30
days). Every release run ends in a `release-health-summary` job that reports
the cleanup conclusion and emits an `::error::` annotation if the cleanup job
did not complete.

## SHA pinning for GitHub Actions

If you add or modify a workflow file in `.github/workflows/`, every `uses:` reference to a third-party action must be pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA with the version as a comment. This is a hard requirement enforced by the security tests.

```yaml
# Correct
- uses: actions/checkout@93cb6efe18208431cddfb8368fd83d5badbf9bfd # v5.0.1

# Wrong — will fail security tests
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/checkout@main
```

To find the SHA for a given tag, run:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/tags/{tag} --jq '.object.sha'
```

## Common mistakes that break the release pipeline

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Replacing release PR body | release-please can't parse its own PR → no tag, no release, no npm publish | Never `gh pr edit --body-file` on a release PR; use prepend only |
| Editing `package.json` version | Merge conflict with release-please on next run | Let release-please manage version fields |
| Editing `CHANGELOG.md` | Merge conflict with release-please on next run | Let release-please manage the changelog |
| Editing `.release-please-manifest.json` | release-please version tracking breaks | Let release-please manage the manifest |
| Using only `docs`/`chore`/`test`/`ci` commit types | No version bump triggered, release PR is never created | Include at least one `feat` or `fix` commit if you want a release |
| Creating tags or releases manually | `publish-npm` job doesn't trigger (gated on release-please output) | Let the pipeline create tags and releases |
| Missing `docs/releases/pending/<slug>.md` | GitHub Release has no useful description | Always add a unique pending fragment for your PR |
| Creating `docs/releases/v{VERSION}.md` in a feature/fix PR | Version prediction collides with release-please; merge conflict hotspot | Use `docs/releases/pending/<slug>.md` instead — release-please owns the version |
| Writing to a shared `docs/releases/unreleased.md` | Same merge-conflict hotspot, just relocated | Use a unique slug under `docs/releases/pending/` per PR |

## Summary checklist for any PR

- [ ] [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) read; touched invariants identified
- [ ] PR body includes an `## Invariant audit` section in the format from `AGENTS.md` (when relevant invariants are touched)
