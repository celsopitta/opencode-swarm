 * The mechanical `stage_a_passed` transition deliberately fails closed from
 * `rework_required` (`TASK_WORKFLOW_CODER_MUTATION_REQUIRED`): a genuine code
 * defect must go back through the coder. But a Stage B verdict that failed
 * WITHOUT a code defect (e.g. a tool-argument mistake scored as a verdict —
 * sibling issue #2756) strands a task whose code is correct, reviewed, and
 * green on Stage A checks, with no agent-legal exit; the only other remedy
 * ever offered is the human-only `/swarm recover`, whose repair leg skips
 * this state entirely.
 *
 * This is the audited escape hatch the #2703 precedent
 * (`approve_retry_sounding_board`) established for exactly this class: it
 * writes the SAME durable transition the mechanical path would have written,
 * admitted ONLY by the `supervisedRecovery` flag the reducer accepts from
 * `rework_required`, and records a distinguishable `stage_a_repair` audit
 * event (action `rework_recovered`). Every precondition fails closed; the
 * mechanical path and the `/swarm recover` auto-scan are untouched.
