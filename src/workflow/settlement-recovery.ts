 * Architect-supervised settlement-backed Stage A recovery (issue #2828).

 * The mechanical `stage_a_passed` transition deliberately fails closed from
 * `idle` and `blocked` (`TASK_WORKFLOW_CODER_MUTATION_REQUIRED` /
 * `TASK_WORKFLOW_TERMINAL`): those labels say the task never started or was
 * deliberately stopped. But the durable receipts can disagree — a COMMITTED
 * accepted coder settlement (the code is committed) plus green
 * post-settlement pre-check bundles (it passed Stage A checks) while the
 * workflow label drifted (`repair_idle` force-repair cleared the proofs, or
 * `task_blocked` moved past a recorded pass). Until this recovery, that
 * disagreement was a total deadlock: `/swarm recover` refused, a
 * `pre_check_batch` re-run could never re-record Stage A (attribution
 * requires `coder_delegated`), `recover_rework_task` requires exactly
 * `rework_required`, and re-dispatching the coder produces no mutation.
 *
 * This is the audited escape hatch the #2755 `recover_rework_task`
 * precedent established for the same class: it writes the SAME durable
 * transition the mechanical path would have written, admitted ONLY by the
 * `settlementRecovery` flag the reducer accepts from `idle`/`blocked`, and
 * records a distinguishable `stage_a_repair` audit event. Every
 * precondition fails closed; the deterministic `/swarm recover`
 * settlement-wedge scan and the mechanical recorder are untouched.
 *
 * Unlike `recover_rework_task` there is no plan-membership precondition: the
 * durable predicates (evidence file + COMMITTED accepted settlement WAL +
 * green post-settlement bundles) already bind the repair to a task that
 * genuinely had a settled coder dispatch, and the deterministic
 * `/swarm recover` scan this tool mirrors enumerates evidence files the same
 * way, plan or no plan. Requiring plan.json here would re-introduce exactly
 * the extra-refusal wedge class this recovery removes.
