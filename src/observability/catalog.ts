/**
 * The event catalog (issue #2029).
 *
 * Exactly 66 entries, matching the `TelemetryEvent` union at
 * `src/telemetry.ts:27-210`. Thirty-eight predate the #2029 contract; the 39th is
 * `agent_conflict_detected` (previously emitted through a force-cast past the
 * type system), the 40th is `close_archive_result` (issue #2030 — the
 * structured close/archive result event), the 41st is the bounded diagnostic
 * projection of authoritative knowledge-receipt transitions (issue #2031).
 * The 42nd is the human-only `knowledge_maintenance` quarantine audit
 * (issue #2033), the 43rd is the aggregate `context_pruned` transcript
 * mutation audit, the 44th is the bounded `residue_health` atomic-write
 * residue audit (issue #2035), the 46th is the bounded
 * `context_telemetry_health` storage audit for the issue-#2037
 * `.swarm/context-telemetry.jsonl` store, the 47th is the counts-only
 * `skill_usage_health` storage audit for the issue-#2038
 * `.swarm/skill-usage.jsonl` store and its authoritative pending sidecar,
 * the 48th is the bounded `core_events_health` storage audit for the
 * issue-#2039 `.swarm/events.jsonl` store, the 49th is the bounded
 * `shell_audit_health` storage audit for the issue-#2040
 * `.swarm/session/shell-audit.jsonl` security-audit store, and the 50th is
 * the bounded `trajectory_health` storage audit for the issue-#2041
 * `.swarm/trajectories/` PRM session store, and the 51st is the bounded
 * `pr_subscription_health` storage audit for the issue-#2042
 * `.swarm/pr-monitor/` subscription checkpoint store. The 52nd is
 * `delegation_cost_correction`, the 53rd is `delegation_cost_binding`, and the
 * 54th is `delegation_cost_join`. The 57th is `council_attempt`, the 58th is
 * `council_round_transition`, and the 59th is `council_attempt_unscoped`
 * (issue #2046 item 9 — canonical council attempt / accepted-transition
 * observations joined to the lifecycle correlation system via the
 * server-derived `councilRoundId`). The 60th is
 * `context_source_attribution` and the 61st is `verdict_row_pipe_recovery` and the 62nd is `training_vault_health`
 * (issue #2482 — D3: honest savings attribution with the omit-when-unknown
 * rule, and the #2184 verdict-row pipe-recovery fidelity class in the event
 * lifecycle). The 63rd is `delegation_read_uncertain` (issue #2511 —
 * bounded advisory-reader uncertainty signal). These late
 * additions are instances
 * of the defect class this contract exists to close: an event kind entering
 * the stream with no registration.
 *
 * Every entry names a real producer `file:line`, a retention owner issue at or
 * above #2030 — every entry today cites the #2030-#2051 programme, but only the
 * LOWER bound is enforced, so a successor issue numbered past that window is not
 * forced into a false in-window citation — a privacy class, a doc anchor and a
 * test file. An entry with no
 * live reader declares `consumers: []` AND a `futureOwnerIssue` — an empty
 * consumer list without an owner is a contract violation, not a shrug.
 *
 * Import rules: no filesystem, network, subprocess, or OTel SDK.
