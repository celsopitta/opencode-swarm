/**
 * Tool METADATA - the single source of truth for every tool's name, description,
 * and default agents. Handler wiring lives in ./manifest.ts.
 *
 * This module imports NO tool handler modules. That is deliberate: constants.ts
 * and tool-names.ts (and a few tool modules, e.g. completion-verify) derive from
 * here, and they are transitively imported by tool modules. If this file imported
 * the handler-bearing manifest, every constants.ts consumer would pull all 82 tool
 * modules and form an init cycle (#507 CI finding). Keeping metadata handler-free
 * makes the module graph acyclic.
 *
 * Cross-checked with ./manifest.ts: that file registers handlers via
 * `defineHandlers<T extends Record<ToolName, () => ToolDefinition>>` with
 * `ToolName = keyof typeof TOOL_METADATA`, so adding a tool here without wiring a
 * handler there (or vice versa) is a COMPILE error - the dead-tools bug class
 * stays impossible.
