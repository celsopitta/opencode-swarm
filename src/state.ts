	 *
	 * Worktree-isolated coder children are created with
	 * `session.create({ query: { directory: <lane> } })`, and their scope binding
	 * is derived and published against that lane. The write gates are constructed
	 * once at plugin init with `ctx.directory` and would otherwise resolve every
	 * session's binding, containment, and `.swarm/` reads against the project
	 * root — which can never match a lane-rooted binding.
	 *
	 * TRUST BOUNDARY: written ONLY by `recordSessionWorkspaceRoot`, whose single
	 * closed allowlist of production callers each pass `provisionWorktree`'s own
	 * output. `ensureAgentSession`'s `directory` argument (which can carry an
	 * agent-supplied `working_directory`, e.g. via `declare_scope`) must NEVER
	 * write this field.
	 *
	 * DELIBERATELY NOT SNAPSHOTTED (issue #2002 follow-up). `serializeAgentSession`
	 * (`src/session/snapshot-writer.ts`) intentionally omits this field, and it
	 * MUST stay omitted. The reason is trust, not oversight: `.swarm/session/state.json`
	 * lives under the project-root `.swarm/` directory, which the architect agent
	 * can write, so a restored string in that file is not a trusted resolution
	 * root — a tampered or stale snapshot could install an arbitrary root, or
	 * re-point a session at a *different* lane it never owned (cross-lane
	 * containment re-rooting). Persisting it would only be safe if rehydrate could
	 * revalidate the restored value against a durable, plugin-owned record of
	 * provisioned lanes, and no such record exists:
	 *   - `worktree-provisioning-owner.ts`'s durable marker
	 *     (`recordWorktreeProvisioningOwner`) stores no `worktreePath` at all, and
	 *     its `worktreeSessionId` field is always the *parent* session id
	 *     (`worktree-isolation.ts` passes `args.parentSessionID`, confirmed by
	 *     every production and test call site) — it cannot answer "does child
	 *     session X own lane path Y".
	 *   - `background-delegations.jsonl` (`src/background/pending-delegations.ts`)
	 *     does carry a `worktree.worktreePath` keyed by the child session id, but
	 *     it is written only inside the `isBackgroundTrue(...)` branch of
	 *     `delegation-gate.ts` (~line 3157) — i.e. only for `background: true` Task
	 *     dispatches. It is never written for the ordinary synchronous worktree
	 *     dispatch in `worktree-isolation.ts`, nor for the Lean Turbo dispatch in
	 *     `src/turbo/lean/lane-scope.ts`, which are the two actual
	 *     `recordSessionWorkspaceRoot` callers. It does not cover the field it
	 *     would need to validate.
	 *   - Re-deriving the expected path from `provisionWorktree`'s own naming
	 *     scheme (`resolveWorktreeBaseDir(directory, worktreeDir)/parentSessionId/taskId`,
	 *     or the `os.tmpdir()/swwt/...` Windows-shortened form) does not close the
	 *     gap either: it requires the child's *parent* session id, which is only
	 *     available from `delegationChains` in the very same untrusted snapshot —
	 *     validating one untrusted field with another untrusted field is circular,
	 *     not a validation. It would also require spawning `git worktree list` per
	 *     restored session inside `loadSnapshot`, which runs on the plugin-init
	 *     path under a bounded timeout (AGENTS.md invariant 1 / repro-704).
	 * Net effect: a plugin restart mid-lane loses the recorded root, and
	 * `resolveSessionWorkspaceDirectory` falls back to the plugin-root directory —
	 * fail-closed, byte-identical to pre-#2002 behaviour, never a widened
	 * authority (see its own doc comment). The lane coder is blocked with
	 * `SCOPE_NOT_DECLARED` (`src/hooks/scope-guard.ts`,
	 * `src/hooks/guardrails/tool-before.ts`) until a human/architect re-dispatches
	 * it, exactly like the pre-fix bug — not worse. `rehydrateState` (which would
	 * apply a restored value) only runs from `loadSnapshot`, itself only called at
	 * plugin init (`src/index.ts`), so this window is a real process restart, not
	 * something that can strip a live in-session lane coder of its root.
	 * Do NOT add this field to `TRANSIENT_SESSION_FIELDS`
	 * (`src/session/snapshot-reader.ts`) either — it is never restored in the

/**
 * Issue #2002 — record the root a session actually EXECUTES in, when it
 * differs from the plugin-root `ctx.directory`.
 *
 * TRUST BOUNDARY (security-critical): this function performs NO path
 * validation. `laneRoot` is trusted purely because of WHO calls it, not
 * because of its shape — `provisionWorktree` can legitimately relocate a lane
 * outside the swarm worktree base (e.g. a `os.tmpdir()`-shortened path on
 * Windows when the path-budget check trips), so a shape predicate would
 * refuse a legitimately provisioned lane and silently reintroduce the bug
 * this closes.
 *
 * The only thing standing between this setter and a privilege-escalation bug
 * is a closed allowlist of production callers, each of which passes
 * `provisionWorktree`'s own return value — never a tool argument, never
 * `ensureAgentSession`'s `directory` parameter (which CAN carry an
 * agent-supplied `working_directory`, e.g. via `declare_scope`). That
 * allowlist is mechanically enforced by
 * `tests/unit/state/session-workspace-root-trusted-callers.test.ts`. Adding a
 * new call site is a privilege-escalation review, not a formality: the
 * reviewer must confirm the new caller passes `provisionWorktree` output
 * before adding it to that test's allowlist.
 *
 * A blank or whitespace-only `laneRoot` is ignored (treated as unset) rather
 * than being recorded and later resolving to `path.resolve('')` (cwd).
 *
 * ORDERING IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. This never creates the session — callers
 * MUST register it with its real agent name (`ensureAgentSession(sessionId,
 * 'coder', laneRoot)`) FIRST. Calling this on an unregistered session is a
 * deliberate no-op, so resolution falls back to the plugin root and the write
 * is blocked. Creating the session here instead would register
 * `swarmState.activeAgent` as 'unknown', which fails OPEN rather than closed —
 * see the inline comment in the body for the full chain.
